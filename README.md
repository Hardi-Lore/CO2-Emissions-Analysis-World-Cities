# CO2 Emission Data Analysis for Different Cities Around the World
This repository is dedicated to the analysis of CO2 emission data from various cities around the world. Our goal is to identify trends and patterns in the data that can provide valuable insights into the environmental impact of different urban areas. We use Python 3 and the pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.

## Data
The analysis is based on two primary datasets:
- cities_emissions.xlsx:
    - This Excel file contains detailed CO2 emission data for different cities worldwide. It serves as the primary source of information for our analysis.

- cities_population_area.xlsx:
    - This Excel file provides additional metadata about the cities in the dataset, such as population and area. These details can be crucial for contextualizing the CO2 emission data.

## Analysis
In this repository, you can:
1. Explore the Data: Load and examine the CO2 emission dataset using Python and pandas to understand the emissions of different cities.

2. Perform Data Analysis: Utilize data analysis techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to CO2 emissions in various urban areas.

3. Visualize the Data: Create visual representations of the data, such as charts and graphs, to make the analysis more accessible and comprehensible.

4. Draw Conclusions: Analyze the findings to draw meaningful conclusions about the environmental impact of different cities and the factors influencing CO2 emissions.

## Usage
